  <p> Global Warming is caused mainly by humans- and here's why.
  </p> Humans have the largest Co2 Imprint out of all animals, as well as reproducing cows who also produce A lot of CO2. Also, using fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline 
    greatly decrease the ozone layer. People also impact global warming by using hairspray/paintspray. This breaks the ozone layer, allowing the sun to have a more impactful ray on 
    earth. For example, heat has been rising aswell as icecaps have been melting, causing floods in coastal countries. If humans could make a conscious effort to stop using fossil fuels
    and start using electrical cars and not eating as much beef, the ozone layer could be better.
