  <p> Global Warming is caused mainly by humans- and here's why.
  </p> Humans have the largest Co2 Imprint out of all animals, as well as reproducing cows who also produce A lot of CO2. Also, using fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline 
    greatly decrease the ozone layer. People also impact global warming by using hairspray/paintspray. This breaks the ozone layer, allowing the sun to have a more impactful ray on 
    earth. For example, heat has been rising aswell as icecaps have been melting, causing floods in coastal countries. If humans could make a conscious effort to stop using fossil fuels
    and start using electrical cars and not eating as much beef, the ozone layer could be better. For example, electrical cars do not use fossil fuels to drive and can be charge overnight
 . Paying for gas is now not needed, however electric cars such as teslas can cost more than an average car. To be more informed about electric cars, you can check out tesla's website.
    To be more informed about global warming you should search what are some ways that you can stop global warming- such as the things I listed above. Some people might not want to 
    support non-global warming yet because of financial reasons, which is understandable since teslas are pretty expensive. However, minor things such as eating less beef can be controlled
    and still contribute to helping the environment.

  <p> cows- they are a huge impact on the large amount of C02 emission in the air </p>

  <p> Electrical cars- they use electricity instead of gasoline which lessens the amount of fossil fuels we burn. This is a good but sometimes expensive alternative to regular cars.</p>
